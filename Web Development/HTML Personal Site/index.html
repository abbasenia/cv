  <h2>All About Me</h2>
  <p>I was born and raised in Long Beach, California. I am the oldest of 3. I have a younger brother and a younger sister. From an early age I always knew I would grow up to be a world famous kangaroo boxer. I started out boxing with koalas but they eventually grew tired of fighting and ran away. One day while wrestling a crocodile in my backyard a kangaroo hopped up to my back gate and watched as I beat the croc to a pulp. Then the kangaroo hopped away. He came back the next day with two friends and his wife. Well, I'm assuming it was his wife. She had a joey in her pocket. Anyway, they watched as I pummeled a large boa constrictor and tied it in knots. Once again, the group, led by the first kangaroo hopped away. They didn't come back the next day because it rained and everything flooded. For 3 days I waited to see them. On the fourth day, just when I had given up, the first kangaroo hopped up with boxing gloves on and boxing shorts. I wiped my eyes thinking I was hallucinating. He even had on a matching boxing robe! He had about 10 kangaroo friends with them. He unlatched the gate and hopped inside, closing it after him. Then he raised his arms to challenge me. I was ready! Neighbors heard about our boxing match and began showing up as word spread through the neighborhood. He was a formidable opponent but I had been waiting for this moment my entire life! I dodged an uppercut and a left hook and hit him with a roundhouse to his left jaw, knocking him out! One of my neighbors filmed it, put it on youtube, and the video was seen by a boxing promoter. And that is how I became a world reknowned professional kangaroo boxer.</p>
